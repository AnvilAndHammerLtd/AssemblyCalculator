A calculator created in Assembly code using the EMU8086 library.

Emulator used: http://emu8086.en.lo4d.com/

The language notation in the video is in Greeklish (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeklish) and you can use this website http://services.innoetics.com/greeklish/ to translate from greeklish to greek (thanks to +English Monster for showing me this website). You can then translate greek to english using google translate.

If someone is willing to translate the source code and do a pull request that would be great :)

Some quick translations:

TIPOTA = Nothing

PROSTHESI = addition

AFERESI = subtraction

POLLAPLASIASMOS = multiplication

LOGIKO = Logical

apotelesma = result
