The language notation in the video is in Greeklish (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeklish) and you can use this website http://services.innoetics.com/greeklish/ to translate from greeklish to greek (thanks to +English Monster for showing me this website). You can then translate greek to english using google translate.


Some quick translations by me:

TIPOTA = Nothing

PROSTHESI = addition

AFERESI = subtraction

POLLAPLASIASMOS = multiplication

LOGIKO = Logical

apotelesma = result
